# Introduction

Notes: In the first example below, I give you a lot of the necessary code to help familiarize you with python and its primary libraries. 
Lecture 3 contained an example of the $k$ nearest neighbors algorithm for a prediction problem. The initial example considered $k=1$ and was applied to the advertising dataset in an attempt to predict sales from TV budgets. Here I reproduce the results from the lecture.
